After my exploration, I have some new thoughts about digital history. 

I feel it different from my previous practice because this time I have to chance to choose material and decide what technology I would use.
I chose the Blackwell family papers digital collection because that beautiful handwriting attracted at the first second. Then I started to think about what technology should I use. 
Surprisingly, I found out that not every technology I learned can be applied --- For example, Excel can only be used for a dataset and Voyant can only be used for digitalized word materials.
And the perfect tools for the Blackwell family are Wget, API and OCR. 
Then I suddenly realized the importance of these digital history techs. 
For instance, there are 222 items in the folder of papers of the Blackwell family. It would take me an hour to download one of them at a time. With the help of Wget, I can easily download hundreds at the same time. 
This experience made me think about how digital history tech can help those researchers because they may face hundreds of thousands of items and these tools can help them to categories this mess. 
Although I am not doing a real history project, I can feel the convenience these tools bring. 
On the other hand, I also feel there are some places to improve in the future. For example, OCR cannot recognize this beautiful handwriting. 

For the question of this week, I have some own explanation. In my perspective, the biggest difference of 'digital historian' with 'historian' is that digital technologies can provide researchers with a much more convenient way to improve the efficiency, and even make some impossible task into possible. 
For example, it is impossible to find a keyword from thousands of pages of materials. But with the help of OCR, researchers can quickly find useful information. 
I think this is my explanation for "80% of our time, as digital historians, is just getting things into shape for us to begin our exploration."
