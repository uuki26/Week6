This week I used three technologies from Week 2 to discover the papers of the Blackwell family.

First, I applied Wget to it. Wget helped me to download lots of materials from the diary at the same time. 

Second, I used python to help me get materials out of an API.

Then, I tired to use OCR to recogize iamges of this diary. However, the whole book was handwritten. So, R studio cannot transfer it into a script. 

Finally, I made a storymap to record all these process.
